# Random Disco Light Simulator

## This simulator takes three inputs:

### Inputs:

1:) How many random colors you want to be shown?<br>
2:) By how much time interval (in milliseconds) you want to change the colors randomly?<br>
3:) What type of gradient you want to choose (conic or linear)?

## Output:

On the basis of these three inputs, it simulates conic or linear view for given number of random colors and time interval.

## Try these inputs:

<table>
        <tr>
            <td>1:)</td>
            <td>1000</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>1000</td>
            <td>7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2:)</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>500</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>500</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3:)</td>
            <td>conic</td>
            <td>linear</td>
            <td>linear</td>
            <td>conic</td>
</table>
