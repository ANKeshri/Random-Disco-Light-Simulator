This simulator takes three input: <br>

#inputs:<br>
1:) What type of gradient you want to choose (conic or linear)?<br>
2:) By how much time interval (in milliseconds) you want to change the colors?<br>
3:) How many random colors you want to be shown?

#output:<br>
On the basis of these three inputs, it simulates conic or linear view for given number of random colors and time interval.
