This simulator takes three input: <br>
1:) Which type of gradient you want to choose (conic or linear)?<br>
2:) By how much time interval(in milliseconds) you want to change the colors?<br>
3:) How many random colors you want to be shown?

On the basis of these three inputs, it shows conic or linear view for given number of random colors and time interval.
